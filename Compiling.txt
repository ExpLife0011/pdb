To compile, you will need a compiled copy of dialib, and the DIA SDK v2.0 
supplied with Visual Studio.NET.

You will also require a copy of Visual Studio.NET. It may be possible to 
compile with earlier versions, but this has not been investigated.

You will also have to adjust the settings in the project for your 
particular configuration:

* C/C++>General>"Additional Include Directories" must be set to point to:
  The DIA SDK's include directory.
  Dialib's include directory.

* Linker>General>"Additional Library Directories" must be set to:
  The DIA SDK's lib directory.
  Dialib's lib directory.
